The Toxicity over Time (ToxT) was developed by Gita Thanarajasingam, MD, to study the side effects (adverse events) of cancer treatments over time. This method allows for investigators to carefully examine the data collected from patients at different points in time throughout a clinical trial. In essence, the ToxT method helps researchers dig deeper into the data from cancer clinical trials to better understand how the side effects of treatments changed over the course of the trials. This information can be valuable for improving cancer treatments and the overall care of cancer patients.
